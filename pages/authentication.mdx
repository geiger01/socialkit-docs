# Authentication

To interact with our API, you'll authenticate requests using your access key. Manage your Access Key securely in your project Access Keys page.

Your Access Key grants significant privileges, so it's crucial to keep it confidential. Avoid sharing your Access Key in public repositories, client-side code, or any publicly accessible areas.

You can attach your access key to requests in any of these ways:

- `GET` parameter: `access_key`
- `POST` parameter: `access_key`
- `Header`: `x-access-key`

## Important Security Reminders

- **Security First:** Your Access Key is sensitive information, treat it as such.
- **Authentication is Mandatory:** API requests without authentication will fail.
