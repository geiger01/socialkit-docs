		"transcript": "Ever been randomly attacked by your cat and thought, what did I do? Don't worry. There's usually a reason behind the chaos. 1, play aggression. Cats are born hunters and sometimes your hand, foot or even your face becomes the prey. 2, over stimulation. If you've been petting them a bit too long, especially on the belly, tail or sides, they might snap to say, that's enough, human. 3, redirected aggression. Like when your cat spots another feline outside, gets frustrated and decides you are now the enemy. 4, territorial vibes. Cats are super protective of their space and sometimes they throw paws to show who's boss. And 5, lack of socialization. If they weren't used to people early on, even a loving touch can feel like a threat. To avoid surprise attacks, learn the warning signs like twitchy tails or pinned ears. Use toys to redirect energy. Don't over pet and always respect their personal bubble.",
